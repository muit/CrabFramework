\n \section start Getting Started

1. Add the sky dome to your scene:
 - Drag the prefab "Time of Day/Prefabs/Sky Dome" into your scene
 - Tweak the parameters until you are satisfied with the result

2. Move the sky dome to the camera position in every frame:
 - Select your camera and add the Time of Day camera script (Component -> Time of Day -> Camera Main Script)
 - Make sure the sky reference is set to the sky dome

3. Render god rays on the camera:
- Select your camera and add the Time of Day god ray script (Component -> Time of Day -> Camera God Rays)
- Make sure the sky reference is set to the sky dome

<b>REMARK:</b>
The camera script moves the sky dome directly before clipping the scene, guaranteeing that all other position updates have been processed. You should not move the sky dome in "LateUpdate" because this can cause minor differences in the sky dome position between frames when moving the camera.



\n \section time Day & Night Cycle

The script TOD_Time manages the dynamic day & night cycle. Enabling and disabling this script enables and disables the automatic time progression.

The following parameters are being set by TOD_Time:
- TOD_Sky.Cycle.Hour
- TOD_Sky.Cycle.Day
- TOD_Sky.Cycle.Month
- TOD_Sky.Cycle.Year

It also offers a time curve that can be modified via the Unity inspector to speed up or slow down certain parts of the day-night cycle. The X axis of the graph denotes the current internal time, which always progresses linearly. The Y axis of the graph denotes the time that is being set in the sky dome and is therefore visible to the player. That means the higher the inclination of the curve the faster this certain part of the day passes by.

The following events are fired by TOD_Time:
- TOD_Time.OnMinute
- TOD_Time.OnHour
- TOD_Time.OnDay
- TOD_Time.OnMonth
- TOD_Time.OnYear



\n \section weather Weather Manager

The script TOD_Weather can be used to automatically set various parameters of TOD_Sky according to certain weather presets.

The following parameters are being set by TOD_Weather:
- TOD_Sky.Atmosphere.Fogginess
- TOD_Sky.Clouds.Density
- TOD_Sky.Clouds.Sharpness
- TOD_Sky.Clouds.Brightness



\n \section location Time Zone & Location Coordinates

The TOD_Sky.World and TOD_Sky.Cycle parameter sections allow for configuration of the sky dome to simulate the exact earth, sun and moon movement for any location on the planet depending on Gregorian date, UTC/GMT time zone and geographic coordinates. This allows to recreate eclipses just as they would occur in real life.

It is important to manually set the correct time zone offset (TOD_Sky.World.UTC) that fits the longitude and latitude parameters in order to use local time instead of UTC.

All of those parameters are completely optional - if the sky dome should be used in a generic fantasy world they can simply be ignored and left at their default values.



\n \section ambient Ambient Light & Reflections

Unity 5 introduced new ways to approximate ambient light and reflections. For a primer on the new features, watch the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoXb-f_pNag">Unite 2014 talk</a>.

Time of Day offers full support for Unity 5 image-based ambient light and reflections. It can update both the per-scene ambient light and a realtime reflection probe at runtime. Ambient light can be disabled (i.e. not managed by Time of Day), a solid color, a gradient or spherical harmonics. Reflections can be disabled (i.e. not managed by Time of Day) or a cubemap. Both ambient light and reflections contain approximations of the atmosphere in the top half and lerp to the configured ambient light color towards the bottom half. This means the ambient light color set on the Time of Day prefab can be looked at as the ground color of the scene in those cases.

Time of Day also allows you to include some or all layers of your scene in the reflection probe bake process. This should be used with care since updating a reflection probe with various reflected objects is an expensive operation. For most scenes it should be fine to only render the sky dome to the realtime reflection probe by using "Skybox" clear flags and a "Nothing" culling mask.



\n \section quality Rendering Quality

There are various different quality levels for the sky dome. Those quality settings can be configured via script or directly in the Unity inspector.

TOD_SkyQuality:
- Per-vertex calculates the sky dome color for every vertex and interpolates between them
- Per-pixel calculates the sky dome color for every pixel

TOD_CloudQuality:
- Bumped offers complex cloud shading with dynamic density and cloud normal mapping
- Density offers simplified cloud shading with dynamic density but without normal mapping
- Fastest offers extremely simplified cloud shading with simplified cloud shape calculations

TOD_MeshQuality:
- High tessellation sky dome (2562 verts) and moon (574 verts)
- Medium tessellation sky dome (642 verts) and moon (294 verts)
- Low tessellation sky dome (162 verts) and moon (148 verts)

For the best visual quality it is recommended to use Time of Day with the following Unity Pro setup:
- Linear color space in player settings
- HDR enabled on the main camera
- The following image effects (in that order)
  1. "Image Effects -> Bloom and Glow -> Bloom" or "SE Natural Bloom & Dirty Lens" from the Asset Store
  2. "Image Effects -> Color Adjustments -> Tonemapping"
  3. "Image Effects -> Color Adjustments -> Color Correction" or "Amplify Color" from the Asset Store



\n \section performance Performance Remarks

- The size of a web player with just the sky dome is only around 200KB as most equations are evaluated dynamically
- All scripts and shaders are highly optimized and will not have a significant FPS impact on desktop computers
- Older mobile devices should choose quality settings that offer suitable performance
- Cloud shadows utilize a Unity projector and require another draw call for all objects they are projected on
- Realtime reflections that include objects other than the sky dome can be expensive and should be used with care



\n \section rendering Rendering Order

All components of the sky dome are being rendered after the opaque but before the transparent meshes of your scene. That means only areas of the sky dome that are not being occluded by any other geometry have to be rendered.

The rendering order of the sky dome components is the following:
- Space Dome  (if not manually disabled)
- Sun Plane   (if on screen)
- Moon Mesh   (if on screen)
- Atmosphere  (if not manually disabled)
- Clear Alpha (if god rays are enabled)
- Cloud Layer (if not manually disabled)
- Billboards  (if billboard clouds are enabled)

This leads to 3-6 draw calls (all billboards can be batched dynamically on Unity Pro) to render the complete sky dome, depending on the scene setup.



\n \section shaders Custom Shaders

The TOD_Sky script sets some global shader parameters that can be used in your custom shaders. For a complete list see the TOD_Base.cginc file. Any of those variables can be used in any shader by simply defining uniform variables with the same name, which will then automatically be set to the most recent values every frame. It is also possible to simply include TOD_Base.cginc to get access to all variables.

In addition to those base variables there is also TOD_Scattering.cginc, which offers functions to easily evaluate the scattering equations in custom shaders.



\n \section networking Networking

- To network date and time, synchronize the property TOD_Sky.Cycle.Ticks of type long
- To network cloud movement, synchronize the property TOD_Sky.Components.Animation.CloudUV of type Vector4



\n \section serialization Parameter Import & Export

It is possible to export custom presets via the "Export" button in the TOD_Sky inspector panel and import them on a different prefab or even in a different project via the "Import" button. Exported parameters can also be loaded at runtime by using the appropriate API calls.



\n \section examples Example Scripts

The package comes with various example scripts to demonstrate sky dome integration.

- AudioAtDay / AudioAtNight / AudioAtWeather:
  Fade audio sources in and out according to a time of day or a specific weather type
- ParticleAtDay / ParticleAtNight / ParticleAtWeather:
  Fade particle systems in and out according to a time of day or a specific weather type
- RenderAtDay / RenderAtNight / RenderAtWeather:
  Enable or disable renderer components according to a time of day or a specific weather type
- LightAtDay / LightAtNight / LightAtWeather:
  Fade light intensities in and out according to a time of day or a specific weather type
- LoadSkyFromFile:
  Load exported sky dome parameters at runtime from a TextAsset that can be assigned via drag & drop



\n \section faq Frequently Asked Questions

Q: How can I get a TOD_Sky reference in my custom scripts?
- TOD_Sky.Instance keeps a static reference to the most recent sky dome that has been instantiated
- TOD_Sky.Instances keeps a static list of referenes to all sky domes that have been instantiated

Q: How can I use the sky dome with virtual reality devices like the Oculus Rift?
- Add the TOD_Camera script to one of the cameras (preferably the one that's being rendered first)
- The sky will render correctly without artifacts

Q: How can I render a cubemap or custom skybox at night?
- Select the shader "Time of Day/Space (Cube)" on the space material
- Assign your cubemap to the material

Q: How can I align the sky dome geographic directions with those of my scene?
- Rotate the sky dome around the y-axis such that the sun rises in the east of your scene

Q: How can I fix Z-fighting and sorting issues with the cloud shadows?
- Adjust the values for "Offset" directly in the shader code of the cloud shadow shaders

<b>REMARK:</b>
Offset values have to be constants and can therefore only be adjusted directly in the shader code. Suitable values depend on the depth buffer resolution of the targeted platform and hardware. While the default values work in most scenarios, some scenes might require some further tweaking.

Q: How can I disable some part of the sky dome?
- Disable any child game object to keep that specific part of the sky dome from rendering
- You can also disable any script on the parent game object individually to disable that specific functionality

<b>REMARK:</b>
Always disable entire child objects instead of their individual components like mesh renderers. The enabled states of components are being be modified by the sky dome scripts, which will otherwise override your changes.
