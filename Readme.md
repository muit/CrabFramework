# Crab Framework for Unity

## What is Crab?
A simple and usefull framework to act as a base of any project or game.

The lack of basic libraries in Unity for Gameplay, AI and game structure in general slows the game development process but adds a lot of freedom on it. Thats why Crab fixes this issue with simple to use tools on the same packet.

## What this is not:
- Non-Programming Unity Extension.
- Set of libraries
- Level editor extension
